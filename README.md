# Twitter stream
Once upon a time in a world far far away there was a girl who knew nothing of code, an ultimate noob. Therefore she decided to learn how to code because she wanted to be a Front-End Developer.

On a particular day a wizard gave her instructions to find an API and to create a real time webapplication. She travelled to the furthest websites and the highest priced API's but she could not find one.

Desperate for one, she turned to Twitter and tried to use oAuth in which she failed again. Until she finally threw her hands up and used the node module for Twitter. Twenty minutes before the deadline the API worked leaving no time to make it real time.

She wept when she pushed her repo to Github.
